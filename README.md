# Text Editor
Summary: To create a simplifed version of notepad. Currently the general layout of the GUI is made but save, saveas, etc functionality still need to be implemented 

Running the editor: To run the editor, create an instance of the text editor. This is done here by running main (use "new TextEditor();" in the main).
